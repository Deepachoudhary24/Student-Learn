# Student-Learn
A beginner friendly learning platform built using HTML.
## 📌 About the Project

**Student Learn** is a beginner-friendly learning platform created as part of my
web development journey.

The main idea behind this project is to provide a simple and organized place
where students can find learning resources for **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
The project focuses on clarity, structure, and ease of understanding for beginners.

The website follows a simple flow:
- A Home page that introduces the platform
- A Login page with basic HTML form validation
- A Resources page that contains curated learning materials and video resources

This project is not meant to be a fully functional learning platform yet.
Instead, it is designed to practice and demonstrate core web development concepts
step by step while learning.

Happy Learning.
